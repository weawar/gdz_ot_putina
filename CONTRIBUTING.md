PRs are completely welcome! As a general rule, `master` is only to be updated when a working build is available at the latest commit, so please don't PR non-passing code. Pushing to `dev` is perfectly fine if you don't want to make enough changes to warrant a whole fork/PR. `dev` will be periodically merged into `master` as long as it is stable, and will be PR'd into `master` if enough has been added to warrant a new release.
